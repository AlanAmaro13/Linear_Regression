# Linear Regression
In this short repository I present a Colaboratory notebook for linear regression using Ordinary Least Squares and Weighted Least Squares

# How to use it:
Open the code on Colaboratory and paste your x and y values in the corresponding cell depeding if your using OLS or WLS, the code will find the correspoding slope and bias also giving you the correlation coefficient $R^{2}$ and it will graphich the estimation for the linear approximation.
